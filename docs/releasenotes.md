### Maintenance
* Added contributing guidelines

### Bug fixes
* Fixed a related regression that affected selection of the `chrom` column.

Post-release `v0.8.6.post0`: requirements files added to MANIFEST.in


## [v0.8.5](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.8.4...v0.8.5)

Date: 2019-04-08

### Bug fixes
* Fixed a regression that prevented selection of bins excluding the `chrom` column.


## [v0.8.4](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.8.3...v0.8.4)

Date: 2019-04-04

### Enhancements
* When creating coolers from unordered input, change the default temporary dir to be the same as the output file instead of the system tmp (pass '-' to use the system one). #150
* `cooler ls` and `list_coolers()` now output paths in natural order. #153
* New option in `cooler.matrix()` to handle divisive balancing weight vectors.

### Bug fixes
* Restore function of `--count-as-float` option to `cooler load`
* Fixed partitioning issue sometimes causing some bins to get split during coarsen
* `rename_chroms()` will refresh cached chromosome names #147
* `Cooler.bins()` selector will always properly convert bins/chrom integer IDs to categorical chromosome names when the number of contigs is very large and therefore the HDF5 ENUM header is missing. Before this would only happen when explicitly requesting `convert_enum=True`.


## [v0.8.3](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.8.2...v0.8.3)

Date: 2019-02-11

### Bug fixes

Date: 2019-01-20

### Enhancements

New options for `cooler dump` pixel output:
* `--matrix` option: Applies to symmetric-upper coolers; no-op for square coolers. Generates all lower triangular pixels necessary to fill the requested genomic query window. Without this option, `cooler dump` will only return the data explicity stored in the pixel table (i.e. upper triangle).
* `-one-based-ids` and `--one-based-starts` convenience options.

### Bug fixes

* A bug was introduced into the matrix-as-pixels selector in 0.8.0 that also affected `cooler dump`. The behavior has been restored to that in 0.7.

Date: 2019-01-02

* Restore but deprecate `cooler.io.ls` for backwards compatibility.


## [v0.8.0](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.7.11...v0.8.0)

Date: 2018-12-31

This is a major release from 0.7 and includes an updated format version, and several API changes and deprecations.

### Schema

* New schema version: v3
* Adds required `storage-mode` metadata attribute. Two possible values: `"symmetric-upper"` indicates a symmetric matrix encoded as upper triangle (previously the only storage mode); `"square"` indicates no special encoding (e.g. for non-symmetric matrices).

### New features

* Support for **non-symmetric** matrices, e.g. RNA-DNA maps.
    * Create function accepts a boolean `symmetric_upper` option to set the storage mode. Default is `True`.
    * Creation commands also use `symmetric_upper` by default, which can be overridden with a flag.
* All main functionality exposed through top-level functions (create, merge, coarsen, zoomify, balance)
* New commands for generic file operations and file inspection.

### API changes

* `cooler.annotate()` option `replace` now defaults to `False`.

* Submodule renaming. Old names are preserved as aliases but are deprecated.
    * `cooler.io` -> `cooler.create`.
    * `cooler.ice` -> `cooler.balance`.

* New top level public functions:
    * `cooler.create_cooler()`. Use instead of `cooler.io.create` and `cooler.io.create_from_unordered`.
    * `cooler.merge_coolers()`
    * `cooler.coarsen_cooler()`
    * `cooler.zoomify_cooler()`
    * `cooler.balance_cooler()`. Alias: `cooler.balance.iterative_correction()`.

* Refactored file operations available in `cooler.fileops`. See the API reference.

### CLI changes

* Various output options added to `cooler info`, `cooler dump`, `cooler makebins` and `cooler digest`.
* Generic data and attribute hierarchy viewers `cooler tree` and `cooler attrs`.
* Generic `cp`, `mv` and `ln` convenience commands.
* New verbosity and process info options.

### Maintenance

* Unit tests refactored and re-written for pytest.

* Documentation updates

Bug fixes
* Fix newline handling for csort when p1 or p2 is last column.
* Fix `--count-as-float` regression in load/cload.

## [v0.7.8](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.7.7...v0.7.8)

Date: 2018-03-18

### Enhancements

* New `cooler cload pairs` command provides index-free loading of pairs.
* Changed name of `create_from_unsorted` to more correct `create_from_unordered`.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed broken use of single-file temporary store in `create_from_unordered`.
* Added heuristic in pairix cload to prevent excessively large chunks. #92
* Added extra checks in `cload pairix` and `cload tabix`. #62, #75


## [v0.7.7](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.7.6...v0.7.7)

Date: 2018-03-16

### Enhancements

* Implementation of unsorted (index-free) loading
    * `cooler.io.create_from_unsorted` takes an iterable of pixel dataframe chunks that need not be properly sorted.
    * Use input sanitization procedures for pairs `sanitize_records` and binned data `sanitize_pixels` to feed data to `create_from_unsorted`. #87 #108 #109
    * The `cooler load` command is now index-free: unsorted `COO` and `BG2` input data can be streamed in. #90. This will soon be implemented as an option for loading pairs as well.
* Prevent `cooler balance` command from exiting with non-zero status upon failed convergence using convergence error policies. #93
* Improve the `create` API to support pandas read_csv-style `columns` and `dtype` kwargs to add extra value columns or override default dtypes. #108
* Experimental implementation of trans-only balancing. #56

### Bug fixes

* Fix argmax deprecation. #99


## [v0.7.6](https://github.com/open2c/cooler/compare/v0.7.5...v0.7.6)

Date: 2017-10-31

### Enhancements

* Cooler zoomify with explicit resolutions
* Towards standardization of multicooler structure
* Support for loading 1-based COO triplet input files

### Bug fixes

* Fixed issue of exceeding header limit with too many scaffolds. If header size is exceeded, chrom IDs are stored as raw integers instead of HDF5 enums. There should be no effect at the API level.
* Fixed issue of single-column chromosomes files not working in `cload`.
* Fixed edge case in performing joins when using both `as_pixels` and `join` options in the matrix selector.

Happy Halloween!
