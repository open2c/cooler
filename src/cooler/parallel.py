"""
Two possible reasons for using a lock

(1) Prevent a concurrent process from opening an HDF5 file while the same
file is open for writing. In order for reading processes to obtain the correct
state, make sure the writing process finishes writing (flushes its buffers and
actually closes the file) before reading processes attempt to open it.
This explicit synchronization shouldn't be necessary if using the file in
SWMR mode.

* <https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf5-quest.html#grdwt>
* <https://support.hdfgroup.org/projects/SWMR>

(2) Synchronize file access when opened before a fork(). Fork-based (Unix)
multiprocessing and concurrent reading are compatible as long as the fork
happens before the child processes open the file. If an HDF5 file is already
open before forking, the child processes inherit the same global HDF5 state,
which leads to a race condition that causes simultaneous access to fail. One
can either use a lock to prevent the race condition, or close and re-open the
file in the workers after the fork.

class MultiplexDataPipe:
    """
    Create an extendable pipeline of callables to be applied independently to
    each of a collection of inputs and produce a collection of outputs.

    New tasks are appended with the ``pipe`` method. Pipeline execution can be
    multiplexed using any ``map`` implementation, e.g. multiprocessing Pool.map
    or ipyparallel view.map for distributed execution.

    Depending on the ``map`` implementation results may be

    * yielded sequentially or online:
        Python 3 ``map`` or ``itertools.imap``, ``Pool.imap``,
        ``Pool.imap_unordered``

    * gathered and returned once all outputs are finished:
        Python 2 ``map``, ``Pool.map``, ``Pool.map_async``

    The pipeline can be run using one of:

    * ``gather``:
        Results are gathered and combined after all pipelines complete.

    * ``reduce``:
        Results are sequentially folded using a binary operator. This can
        save on memory when using a sequential or online ``map``
        implementation.

    Both methods are blocking, regardless of the blocking behavior of the
    ``map`` implementation (e.g., ``Pool.map_async``).

    Notes
    -----
    Python's multiprocessing module uses Pickle for serialization, which has
    several limitations. Consider using a parallel map implementation that uses
    a more versatile serializer, such as dill or cloudpickle.

    See also
    --------
    http://stackoverflow.com/a/26521507 for a discussion of the differences
    between multiprocessing Pool implementations.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> X = np.arange(30)
    >>> spans = [(0, 10), (10, 20), (20, 30)]
    >>> dp = MultiplexDataPipe(lambda span: X[span[0]:span[1]], spans, map)
    >>> dp = dp.pipe(lambda x: x - 1).pipe(sum)
    >>> dp.gather()
    [35, 135, 235]
    >>> dp.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, 0)
